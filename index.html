	<p>
	15-441/641 is an introductory course in computer networks. The emphasis
	will be on the basic performance and engineering tradeoffs in the
	design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues
	more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects
	requiring significant design and implementation.
	</p>

	<p>
	The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are
	and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they
	are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw
	examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include:
	congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming,
	multi-casting, switching, internetworking, and network
	security. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, the projects,
	one mid-term exam and one final.

<p> "Introduction to Computer Systems" is a
  prerequisite for the course.  It is offered under the following
  course numbers 15-213, 18-213, and 15-513.  Graduate students must
  get a B to satisfy the prerequisite.  Students who have taken the
  prerequisite course at CMU get priority when we move students from
  the waiting list.  </p> 
<p> Once student who meet the prerequisites
  have been cleared, we will consider students with a strong systems
  background. These decisions will be made in the first or second week
  of the semester.  Do not send mail to the instructors about this
  (e.g., explaining your background) - it will not help your case.

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Course Policies</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
	<h4>Collaboration</h4>

	<p>Students are encouraged to talk to each other, to the TAs, to the
	instructors, or to anyone else about any of the assignments. Any
	assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and
	sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write
	out his or her own solutions to the homework. </p>

	<p>The project handouts have more detailed information about collaboration when
	working on the projects, but, basically, each programming project group must
	write their own code and documentation for the programming projects done as a
	group.</p>

	<p>Consulting another student's or group's solution is prohibited and submitted
	solutions may not be copied from any source.  You may not supply work that you
	complete during 15-441 to other students in future instances of this course
	(just as you may not use work completed by students who've taken the course
	previously).  If you have any question about whether some activity would
	constitute cheating, please feel free to ask the instructors.</p>

	<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
	The <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm">Carnegie
	Mellon University Policy on Integrity</a> applies.  We will strictly follow
	university policy on reporting cases of cheating.

	<h4>Late Policy</h4>

	<p>Take project and homework deadlines seriously. Our experience is that
	students often seriously underestimate the effort involved in programming
	assignments and projects. If we give you 4 weeks to complete an assignment,
	there is typically a reason.  In the interest of fairness, we have adopted
	the following late policy:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Each student is given a total of 2 &quot;free points&quot; to use during the
	  semester.</li>
	  <li>One free point can be used to extend the deadline of any homework
	  assignment or Project 1 by a single day with no penalty.</li>
	  <li>Two free points are needed to extend the deadline of Projects 2 or
	  3 by a single day with no penalty (you and your partner might each
	  contribute a point).</li>
	  <li>In the absence of free points, the deadline for any assignment
	      can be extended with a 15% penalty per day.</li>
	  <li>No deadline can be extended by more than two days, regardless
	   of how many free points you have saved up.  Assignments will <b>NOT</b>
	   be accepted 48 hours after the due date.</li>

	  <li><i>If you are ill</i>: If you have a medical note, you may turn
	  in your assignments late without using free points.  Please contact
	  the instructors to arrange a reasonable replacement turn-in time.
	  <b>You must notify us before the due-date</b>.
	  Without a medical note, you must use your free points as you would
	  with any other reason for being late.</li>

	</ul>

	<h4>Re-Grading</h4>

	<p>If you think we made a mistake in grading, please return the
	assignment with a note explaining your concern to the course secretary
	no later than two weeks after the day the assignment was returned. We
	will have the question re-graded by the person responsible for grading
	that question.</p>

	<h4>Partner Problems</h4>

	<p>Please try to avoid having partner problems.  Seriously!  Share your hopes
	before they turn into concerns, your concerns before they are problems, and
	your problems before they inflate into crises.</p>

	<p>In order for the course staff to help you and your partner work through
	issues, or for us to provide an appropriate response to serious partner
	problems, you <i>must</i> contact us <i>well before</i> the relevant due date!
	A special case to avoid is coming to us a day or two before a major deadline to
	tell us that your partner has been ill (etc.) for multiple weeks.  We, and thus
	you, have many more options if you inform us <i>while</i> a problem is
	developing, instead of after the fact.</p>

	<h4>Taking Care of Yourself</h4>


	<p> Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.  </p>


	<p> All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. </p>


	<p> If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.  </p>

	<b>Piazza</b>: <br />
	  If you have a question about a project handout or a technical

	the same question.  Please read the posts on Piazza to see if there
	has been traffic, and consider posting your questions there.</li>
	<li><b>Staff mailing list:</b> <span class="email">staff-441 at cs dot cmu dot edu</span><br />
	  If you have a question you believe is particular to your circumstances
	  and should not be posted in a public forum send mail to the staff list,
	  which reaches the instructors and TAs.  If your question involves a
	  confidential personal or academic-conduct issue, you should probably
	  contact one of the instructors in person or send mail to both.</li>
